# 🔍 Smart Product Recommendation System

## 📌 Overview
The **Smart Product Recommendation System** is a Streamlit-based web application that provides personalized product recommendations based on user queries. It leverages **TF-IDF vectorization** and **cosine similarity** to identify similar products and recommend relevant accessories. Users can apply filters such as **price range, rating, brand, and category** to refine their search.
